# portfolioLandingPage
I created the landing page for my portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
The page is divided into sections that can be easily accessed through the nav bar.
The site is also responsive. When it is change into a phone-size screen the nav bar collapsees into a hamburger button.
